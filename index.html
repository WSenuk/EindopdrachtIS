          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Our podcast</strong> is a tribute to music in all its forms.
            A journey through melodies, rhythms, and stories that are much more
            than the songs themselves: it’s about the background behind each
            tune. We'll dive from genres and iconic artists to the effects of
            music on culture and personal life, and what truly makes it strong
            and connecting.
